                        Labeling a Flat File CMS as "ancient technology" might be misleading, even though its
                        foundational principle—storing data in simple, non-relational files—harks back to the
                        early days of computing. The concept itself is indeed old, but the modern
                        implementations of Flat File CMS are anything but outdated. They incorporate
                        contemporary web development practices, design philosophies, and technologies, making
                        them suitable for various modern use cases.&rdquo; - Chat GPT-4

               <aside class="notes">
                  Simplicity: Without the need for a database, the setup and maintenance of a Flat File CMS are
                  generally simpler. This makes it an attractive option for small websites or projects where a
                  database might be overkill.
                  Performance: Accessing and serving content from flat files can be faster than querying a
                  database, especially for small to medium-sized websites. This can lead to quicker page load
                  times.
                  Portability: Because all content resides in files, it's easy to move or backup the entire
                  website. You can essentially copy the site's folder to migrate or backup your website, without
                  needing to export or import databases.
                  Security: Without a database, the attack surface is reduced. There are fewer vectors for attacks
                  such as SQL injection, making a Flat File CMS potentially more secure out-of-the-box.
                  Version Control: Managing content files through version control systems (like Git) is
                  straightforward, allowing for better tracking of changes and collaboration among developers.

               <p>Early Web Development (Late 1990s to Early 2000s)</p>
               <p>Rise of Database-Driven CMS (Early to Mid-2000s) </p>
               <p>Resurgence with Modern Web Dev Trends (2010s)</p>
               <small>
                  Jamstack and Headless CMS (Late 2010s to Present): The popularity of flat file systems has also
                  been bolstered by the broader adoption of Jamstack architecture and headless CMS platforms.
                  These approaches prioritize pre-rendered pages and microservices over traditional monolithic,
                  database-driven architectures. While not all Jamstack or headless CMS solutions use flat files
                  exclusively, the philosophy aligning with simplicity, performance, and security complements the
                  flat file approach, maintaining its relevance in the web development ecosystem.
               </small>
               <aside class="notes">
                  Early Web Development (Late 1990s to Early 2000s): In the earliest days of the web, flat file
                  systems were quite common simply because they were straightforward to implement and manage.
                  Early websites were often static and manually edited, making the simplicity of flat files
                  appealing. However, this period did not necessarily represent a peak of popularity; it was more
                  about the technological limitations and practices of the time.
                  Rise of Database-Driven CMS (Early to Mid-2000s): As the web grew in complexity and dynamic
                  content became more desired, the popularity of database-driven CMSs like WordPress, Joomla, and
                  Drupal surged.
                  Resurgence with Modern Web Development Trends (2010s): There has been a noticeable resurgence in
                  the interest and use of flat file CMS in the past decade. This resurgence is partly due to the
                  modern web development trends emphasizing speed, security, and simplicity. The rise of static
                  site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, and others, along with modern flat file CMS solutions,
                  reflects this shift. Developers and site owners looking for faster, more secure, and simpler to
                  maintain websites started to adopt these tools for certain types of projects, such as blogs,
                  portfolios, and small business websites.

                  NIPs stand for Nostr Improvement Proposals. These are proposals made by members of the Nostr community

                  BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) in the Bitcoin ecosystem or EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)
                  in the Ethereum ecosystem, NIPs serve as a standardized way for individuals to propose and document

               <h2>NIP-23 example </h2>

               <small>
                  This NIP defines kind:30023 (a parameterized replaceable event) for long-form text content, generally
                  referred to as "articles" or "blog posts". kind:30024 has the same structure as kind:30023 and is used
                  to save long form drafts.

                  "Social" clients that deal primarily with kind:1 notes should not be expected to implement this NIP.
               </small>

               <h3>Format</h3>
               <small>


                  The .content of these events should be a string text in Markdown syntax. To maximize compatibility and
                  readability between different clients and devices, any client that is creating long form notes:

                  MUST NOT hard line-break paragraphs of text, such as arbitrary line breaks at 80 column boundaries.

                  MUST NOT support adding HTML to Markdown.

               </small>


               <h3>Editability</h3>
               <small>


                  These articles are meant to be editable, so they should make use of the parameterized replaceability
                  feature and include a d tag with an identifier for the article. Clients should take care to only
                  publish and read these events from relays that implement that. If they don't do that they should also
                  take care to hide old versions of the same article they may receive.
               </small>

               Will this be turned into a company ?
            </p>
            <small>
               No, it cannot be a for profit company cause the product essentially needs to stay free to remove the
               barrier to entry.<br>
               A support company around it might be possible but not the purpose (RMS)
