					<h2>What is a Flat File CMS ?</h2>
					<p>

						A type of Content Management System that stores content in simple files rather than in a database.
					</p>

					<p>
						<small>
						<blockquote >
							&ldquo;
							Labeling a Flat File CMS as "ancient technology" might be misleading, even though its foundational principleâ€”storing data in simple, non-relational filesâ€”harks back to the early days of computing. The concept itself is indeed old, but the modern implementations of Flat File CMS are anything but outdated. They incorporate contemporary web development practices, design philosophies, and technologies, making them suitable for various modern use cases.&rdquo;

							<h2>Pro's to a flat file setup ?</h2>
							<small>
							<ol>
								<li>Simplicity: Without the need for a database, the setup and maintenance of a Flat File CMS are generally simpler. This makes it an attractive option for small websites or projects where a database might be overkill.</li>
								<li>Performance: Accessing and serving content from flat files can be faster than querying a database, especially for small to medium-sized websites. This can lead to quicker page load times.</li>
								<li>Portability: Because all content resides in files, it's easy to move or backup the entire website. You can essentially copy the site's folder to migrate or backup your website, without needing to export or import databases.</li>
								<li>Security: Without a database, the attack surface is reduced. There are fewer vectors for attacks such as SQL injection, making a Flat File CMS potentially more secure out-of-the-box.</li>
								<li>Version Control: Managing content files through version control systems (like Git) is straightforward, allowing for better tracking of changes and collaboration among developers.</li>

							<h2>Con's to a flat file setup ?</h2>
							<p>								There are also some disadvantages, including scalability issues for very large websites or those with high concurrency demands, and the potential lack of dynamic features* that are easier to implement with a database-driven approach.

						<h2>Small History </h2>
							<small>
								<ol>
									<li>Early Web Development (Late 1990s to Early 2000s): In the earliest days of the web, flat file systems were quite common simply because they were straightforward to implement and manage. Early websites were often static and manually edited, making the simplicity of flat files appealing. However, this period did not necessarily represent a peak of popularity; it was more about the technological limitations and practices of the time.</li>
									<li>Rise of Database-Driven CMS (Early to Mid-2000s): As the web grew in complexity and dynamic content became more desired, the popularity of database-driven CMSs like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal surged. </li>
									<li>Resurgence with Modern Web Development Trends (2010s): There has been a noticeable resurgence in the interest and use of flat file CMS in the past decade. This resurgence is partly due to the modern web development trends emphasizing speed, security, and simplicity. The rise of static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, and others, along with modern flat file CMS solutions, reflects this shift. Developers and site owners looking for faster, more secure, and simpler to maintain websites started to adopt these tools for certain types of projects, such as blogs, portfolios, and small business websites.</li>
								</ol>

						<h2>Present Time  </h2>
							<small>

									Jamstack and Headless CMS (Late 2010s to Present): The popularity of flat file systems has also been bolstered by the broader adoption of Jamstack architecture and headless CMS platforms. These approaches prioritize pre-rendered pages and microservices over traditional monolithic, database-driven architectures. While not all Jamstack or headless CMS solutions use flat files exclusively, the philosophy aligning with simplicity, performance, and security complements the flat file approach, maintaining its relevance in the web development ecosystem.
